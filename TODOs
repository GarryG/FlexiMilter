Here are some errors I came accross while writing milter-tmpmail

* when connecting to the server via IPv6, the connection to the milter was
  immediately terminated with the error message:

	Milter: connect, ending

  (with milter debugging enabled in sendmail)

> This was caused by NETINET6 not being defined by default in the sendmail
  source. I probably missed that somewhere, so I hacked the definition
  into the file include/sm/gen.h with

  #define NETINET6 1

  After rebuilding the library, subsequent connections with IPv6 worked
  fine. I reckon this ought to be fixed more cleanly ;)
