Please note:

FlexiMilter does not come with any waranty, either explicit or
implied, as to functionality, features or correctness. There may very
well (or likely) be errors in the code, albeit I can state that I have
been using it on my own mailserver for about 2 years, and the current
main code file has been in continuous use and unchanged since over 11
months. I am not aware of any unintentionally lost mails (though take
credit for intentionally losing - or rather rejecting - lots of
unwanted mails through the filtering mechanisms implemented).

There is still quite a bit of work especially in the department of
code cleanup and documentation, as this was originally mainly intended
as a quick hack. Especially the multi-tenancy is as of current only
partially implemented (web frontend for other user's config
limitations isn't programmed yet, as it was not needed by myself yet).
